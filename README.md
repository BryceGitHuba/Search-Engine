# Book Search Engine

The Book Search Engine provides users with access to an extensive API book library, allowing them to search for any book and receive in-depth details, including descriptions and author names.

## Description

This website is designed for anyone interested in finding books and gaining insights into what they will be reading. Whether you're a casual reader, researcher, or student, this tool will help streamline your search for quality book information.

## Getting Started
in render
### Dependencies

- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Node.js (Recommended version: 14.x or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

### Installing

Clone the repository and install the dependencies to get started with the Book Search Engine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-search-engine.git
cd book-search-engine
npm install
Executing program
To run the program, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the server and host the application on http://localhost:3001 by default. Open this address in your web browser to interact with the application.

Help
For common issues, such as server start-up problems, ensure all dependencies are installed. If issues persist, try deleting the node_modules folder and reinstalling the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
Usage
Below is an example screenshot of the application:

Note: Update the screenshot URL to the actual path where your image is located.

Development
The project is structured as a full-stack application with both a client and server side. The client directory contains the React front-end application, and the server directory houses the Node.js and Apollo/GraphQL server.

Building for Production
To create a production build of the frontend, run the following command in the client directory:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This command will generate a dist folder containing the compiled frontend that the server will serve.

Testing
Currently, there are no automated tests set up for this system. (Or describe how to run the tests if you have them set up.)

Deployment
Additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system will be added later. (Or provide specific deployment instructions if available.)
